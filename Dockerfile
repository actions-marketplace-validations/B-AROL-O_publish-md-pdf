# file: Dockerfile

# checkov:skip=CKV_DOCKER_3: this image is used as a GitHub Docker container action; GitHub
# Actions requires such containers to run as root to write into the mounted GITHUB_WORKSPACE
# (see https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/dockerfile-support).
# The equivalent Trivy finding (AVD-DS-0002) is suppressed via .trivyignore for the same reason.
#
# Pinned by digest, not just tag: "bookworm-slim" is a moving pointer, so an unpinned FROM can
# resolve to a different image on every rebuild of the same commit. Two rendering regressions
# already came from exactly that kind of untracked toolchain drift (WeasyPrint dropping CSS
# Color 4 alpha in #21/#23; pandoc changing <figure>/<figcaption> handling in #14) -- see #27.
# Resolved from the "bookworm-slim" manifest list via the registry API; update by re-resolving
# that tag, not by hand.

# fonts-noto-color-emoji is a rendering dependency, not a nicety: the only fonts
# otherwise present are the DejaVu family that weasyprint/chromium pull in, and
# DejaVu has no glyph for any emoji outside a handful of dingbats. WeasyPrint
# lays a missing glyph out as blank space rather than a visible box, so without
# this every emoji in a document -- including the ac:emoticon elements
# lib/convert-md.sh converts out of a fetched Confluence page -- silently
# renders as a gap in the PDF. Verified with a real Confluence meeting-notes
# page whose section headings are all emoji-prefixed.
